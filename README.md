# Risk Return Analysis

In this risk return analysis we have take 4 fund portfolios and the S&P 500 to evaluate possible new investment options for inclusion in client portfolios. To determine this, we are looking at the investment's potential based on the four key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe Ratios, and betas.

## Datasets

whale_navs.csv -- contains data on the net asset value (NAV) for four portfolios (Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Tiger Global Management LLC, Paulson & Co. Inc, Soros Fund Management LLC) and the S&P 500 from October 2014 to September 2020. In this case the four portfolios are the 'whale' investors that we will be choosing from, with the S&P 500 index being our benchmark.

## Key Risk-Management Metrics

Daily Returns -- allows us to look at the performance of the portfolio and see if any of the four fund portfolios outperform the S&P 500

Standard Deviations -- allows us to evaluate the risk/volatility of each portfolio using a 21-day rolling window

Sharpe Ratios -- allows us to determine the overall risk of the portfolios by seeings its risk-return

Betas -- allows us to evaluate how the portfolios react relative to the broader market, or in our case the S&P 500 and how the four portfolios move in retrospect to our benchmark using a 60-day rolling window
